1\. Try to re-download the movies.  
 2\. Lower the playback quality: iTunes > Preferences > Playback.  
 3\. Go to Window on the top bar > click Miniplayer > then click play button from the miniplayer.  
 4\. iTunes DRM content won't play on non-Apple devices. To play iTunes purchases, you need to [remove iTunes DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).   
 5\. Convert any incompatible formats with an video or [audio converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for iPhone.
