Senior executives from PwC and Dell presented best practices for deploying RPA with content intelligence for frictionless purchase order processing and extracting data from multiple semi-structured and unstructured documents. 

“The level of interest and enthusiasm at this year’s technology summit was outstanding as partners and customers actively engaged in sessions and discussions focusing on how to make RPA robots smarter using ABBYY solutions,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY. “Organizations know the benefits of RPA, they are now wanting to achieve higher value than automation of basic tasks. They left the ABBYY Technology Summit with examples from global customers and partners on how they can achieve more intelligence from their content, processes, organization and customers.”
