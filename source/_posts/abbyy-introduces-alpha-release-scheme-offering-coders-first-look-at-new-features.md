##### Selected MVPs will proactively engage with community to accelerate awareness and ROI with ABBYY solutions

ABBYY, a leading provider of purpose-built AI for intelligent automation, today launched the ABBYY Most Valuable Professional (MVP) program highlighting inaugural members of its technical community. The ABBYY MVP program awards the title of MVP to developers and technical users who demonstrate exceptional proficiency in ABBYY AI and significant contribution to the ABBYY community, recognizing them for innovative use of AI technologies and their efforts to share their expertise with others. ABBYY MVPs are go-to individuals for insights and feedback, driving successful adoption and value from ABBYY solutions.

Becoming an [ABBYY MVP](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) yields many exclusive opportunities for continuous innovation and professional connection, both remote and in-person. While benefits will continuously evolve and expand, initial benefits include industry-wide recognition, exclusive access to the ABBYY product roadmap, opportunities to feature case studies and the chance to appear on the [AI Pulse Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcawcg-HXtXeE7L%5FeP5yIE8vg64jhaUXj) as a guest speaker.

Inaugural members of the ABBYY MVP program include [Andrew Pett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrew-pett-b949883) of Engeneum Limited, [Shivam Ghelani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivghelani/) of Extra Technology LTD, [Travis Spangler](http://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-spangler-34625060) of Naviant, Inc., and [Vivek Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-kumar-a605233a/) of Proservartner Services LTD, as well as four professionals from ABBYY.

I joined the ABBYY MVP program to leverage cutting-edge AI and intelligent automation technologies, enhancing my ability to deliver transformative solutions.

By integrating ABBYY's advanced tools and utilizing this program’s access to others within the ABBYY community, I will be enabled to provide clients with unparalleled insights and operational excellence. Clients and partners throughout the globe will substantially benefit from the ABBYY MVP ecosystem and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.

Travis Spangler, Vice President of Intelligent Document Processing Sales and Strategy at Naviant

The market continues to steer itself towards more strategic and purposeful use of AI, and early adopters are turning to power users to guide their maturation.

ABBYY has cultivated a robust community through ABBYY University, the AI Pulse Developer Conference and the ABBYY Marketplace that empower engagement and accelerate the business value of our portfolio of intelligent automation solutions. We’re excited to recognize MVPs and leverage their passion and expertise to drive purpose-built AI in business.

Bruce Orcutt, Chief Marketing Officer at ABBYY

ABBYY MVPs can be self-nominated or nominated by others. The application period is from November 1 through December 31 each year, with winners announced in January. Selection criteria include expertise in ABBYY technologies and commitment to mentor, engage and share knowledge with the community. Applications will reopen in November 2024 for selection to the MVP program in 2025.

With the industry’s first cloud-based low-code platform for intelligent document processing (IDP) as well as AI-enabled process intelligence, ABBYY elevates users to drive efficiency and agility through high-quality data and enhanced visibility.
