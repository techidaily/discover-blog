_Hi, I've had a Macbook Pro for about a year now, and I'm pretty happy with it. I've used up about 255GB of the disc space on it and I'm wondering how I can free up more space (Like get it back so there's 250+GB left). I'm used to doing this on a PC and I'm still fairly new on a Mac. Thanks. - Daniel_

The problem "startup disk is full on mac" is all too common for Mac users. Even if you buy a Mac with a 750GB hard disk, you can run out of the Mac space quickly with lots of media files such as movies, music and photos. Worse still, iTunes or Photo library can quickly fill up the 64GB or 128GB SSD of Macbook Pro/Air, leaving little room for anything else. It's awfully terrible to have low space on Mac, and you'll get crazy when your Mac runs slowly. So **how to free up space on MacOS**? Here are 13 quick tips to clean up gigabytes of disk space on Macbook Pro, Macbook Air and iMac, iMac Pro.

## Pre-preparations Before You Make more Space on Your Startup Disk

 Before you start to free up drive space on Mac, there are two things to do: 

1. **Check the used/available disk space** \- Click the Apple menu > Select "About This Mac" > Click on the "More Info" button > Choose the "Storage" tab to check the disk storage overview and capacity.
2. **Backup important or useful files** \- We cannot rule out the possibility that you need to delete files to clean up disk space on Mac. So you'd better backup important and useful files before Mac disc cleanup. Then follow tips below to figure out how to win back some storage space on Mac.
