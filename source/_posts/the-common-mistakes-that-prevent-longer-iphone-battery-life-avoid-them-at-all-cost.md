**2) Don't Play Games or Watch Movies During iPhone Charging** 

If you play video games or watch movies on iPhone during charging, your [iPhone will get really hot and even overheating](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). This has a whopping negative influence on your iPhone 8 Li-Ion battery lifespan. Your iPhone lithium-ion battery is suitable to work with temperature 0 - 35℃, **20℃ best**. 

So supposing you really want to watch movies, you're advised to transfer movies from iPhone to Mac/PC to watch on computer with a powerful [iPhone file transfer app](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

![tip to improve iPhone 8 battery life](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/watch-movie.jpg) 

**3) Li-Ion Battery Should Be Charged Early and Often** 

The times of iPhone battery charge - discharge cycle is 500 and after that number, your Li-Ion battery can only occupy 80% of the original battery life. So you are supposed to charge iPhone 8 early and often. Not fully charging or discharging is a way to protect and save iPhone battery life. 

Keep iPhone 8 battery life between **60% and 80%**, which is a useful way to enhance iPhone battery.

**5）Use iPhone Original Charger** 

To [save iPhone battery life](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), this iPhone tip you might not be familiar, but it does matter. You charge your iPhone with original charger, instead of some irregular or inferior chargers or iPad charger, lest the excess of electricity or unstable electric current causes severe damages on electronic components and then reduces iPhone battery lifespan.

**6) Don't Use Computer & Power Bank to Charge iPhone**

The voltage and electric current of computer and power bank are usually lower than the standard of battery charge. Especially some power banks are labeled with qualified specifications, but actually they are not up standard. 

Granted you utilize computer or power bank to charge iPhone quite often, it will damage your iPhone battery or even worse ruin your iPhone.

## 2 - Develop Good Habits

**1) Power Saver App or Battery Care App (×) - Not Save iPhone Battery**

There are an expansive library of power saver app or battery care [app for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) devices in the App Store. They claim to help you prolong iPhone battery life. But I'm not buying this. I once used Battery Doctor but find that it means nothing to me. 

It constantly detects your current iPhone battery life and doesn't do anything positive to save iPhone battery life. When it runs in the background, it even makes my iPhone really hot. In short, their adverse impacts tower over positive influences. 

![improve battery on iPhone 8](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/battery-doctor.jpg) 

**2) Upgrade iPhone to the Latest iOS**

Usually, the upgraded iOS operating system performs stronger than its predecessor in all aspects, battery life no exception. Thus, you should [upgrade iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) on iPhone and iPhone to the latest iOS 17 or later to prolong iPhone battery. In iOS, there is a Battery Health feature which will tell you the battery status and you can disable apps accordingly.

If you worry your iPhone files get lost during the iOS update, you can utilize [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to bulk transfer music, video, movie, photos, iBooks, ringtones, audio books, etc. from iPhone 8/Plus to computer for backup. The whole process is fast and safe, no files missing.

**3) Don't Use iPhone for Long Time under a Hot/Cold Environment**

The temperature of hot summer climbs above 35℃ and you should not use your iPhone for a long time. That's because iPhone will get overheating very quickly and might go wrong or even explode. 

Likewise, you're also suggested to not use iPhone in a very cold environment, for the Lithium Ion will become inactive below zero and lag in response. iPhone will get damaged if these conditions last for a long time.

**4) Prolong iPhone Battery Life, iPhone External Battery Case Effective?**

The most direct way to improve iPhone battery life is to install an external smart battery case, which is designed to give you even longer battery life and protection. Many users say it's cool and excellent. But some says no difference on having it and it looks pretty rough after only one week. It's not worth its price. So if you plan to buy this external smart battery case for your iPhone, you'd better think it over.

## 3 - Adjust iPhone Settings 

**1) Turn Down the Brightness and Disable True Tone** 

 iPhone series are paired with gorgeous True Tone display. The feature will offer the most natural viewing experience under different light. However, the ability to detect ambient light needs a lot of battery. To prolong iPhone battery life, you can disable True Tone.

Besides, one useful setting to improve iPhone battery life is to turn down the brightness of display from 100% to 50%, which will save battery life on iPhone to certain extent. Access to "Setting" → "Display & Brightness" → Turn off "Auto-Brightness" → manually turn down brightness to **50% or lower**.

**2) Turn Off Background App Refresh & Notifications** 

Some apps you rarely use and their notifications don't amount to much. But if you don't set up them, they will steal your celluar data, but also consume iPhone battery a lot. To **save iPhone battery**, please go to "Settings" → "General" → turn the slide bar of "Background App Refresh" to grey. Back to "Setting" → "Notifications" and click the app icon to close "Allow Notifications".

**3) Change Mail Fetch New Data from Push to Fetch** 

Another tip to [prolong iPhone battery life](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) you might not know is your Mail. If your Mail is set as "Push", your mail new data will be pushed to your iPhone X from the server when possible, which will consume a great deal of iPhone battery. 

You can go to "Settings" → "Mail" →"Account" → "Fetch New Data" →turn off "Push" and set Fetch every 15mins, 30 mins, Hourly or Manually. Fetch less, battery more. And the same method applies to set up Contacts and Calendar.

![set mail Fetch New Data](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/mail-setting.jpg) 

**4) Connect to Wi-Fi instead of Celluar Data to Maximize iPhone Battery Life** 

Your iPhone signal intensity is related to iPhone battery life. When you open celluar data in a place with weak signal, your iPhone needs to consume more battery life to seek for signal. 

Hence, if you need various apps running with network, you'd better connect to Wi-Fi, rather than celluar data. In case you are trapped with a place with no Wi-Fi or signal, it's sensible to turn on Airplane Mode to **extend iPhone battery life**.

![improve iPhone 8 battery life](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/iphone-wifi.jpg) 

**5) Other Settings to Improve iPhone Battery Life** 

\# Turn off Automatic Downloads and Use Cellular Data in iTunes & App Stores.  
\# Go to Settings → Privary → close Location Services to enhance Phone battery. 

\# Shut Siri, Spotlight, Handoff, CarPlay in General if you don't use them frequently.  
\# Turn on   **Low Power Mode** to save iPhone battery life when your iPhone battery is not enough.
