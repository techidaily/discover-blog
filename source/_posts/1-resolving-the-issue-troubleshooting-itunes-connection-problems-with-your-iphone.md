## Why Is iPhone Not Syncing with iTunes? 

Understanding the reason to the "iPhone won't sync with iTunes" problem can help you fix the error. And below are the main reasons.

 \* Outdated iTunes version

 \* Connection problem betwen iPhone and computer

 \* Network connection problems

 \* Problematic iTunes settings ([Check iTunes errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \- [Code 54](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/))

 \* Conflicting iPhone settings 

## Top Fixes for iTunes Not Syncing Music/Photos to iPhone iPad or iPod 

1\. First of all, please start with the very basic thing: make sure you have the latest version of iTunes. If not, just update to the newest iTunes v12.8.3.1\. Normally, most of the "iPhone not syncing with iTunes or [iTunes not recognizing/connecting iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) issues will be fixed. 

**Note:** Only the iPhones running on iOS 17 or later can sync with iTunes V12.8, which is installed on Mac running on macOS 10.11.6 or later and PC running on Windows 10/8/7\. See [how to update to macOS Ventura >>](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac%2Fhow-to-update-macos.htm), [how to update to iOS 17 >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

2\. If the iTunes syncing works but no music, photos, or apps is imported to iPhone, disable the "Manually manage music and videos" under Summary tab and force manual syncing data to iPhone through drag and drop. Enable "Sync Music", "Sync Movies" etc under the tabs of "Music", "Movies", etc. Tab Sync button after checking and unchecking the boxes. The manual syncing with iTunes will, to some degree, solve the content and media transfer issues on iPhone 13 and earlier models. 

3\. Another tip for [iTunes not syncing music](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), photos, files etc when the Sync button is greyed out or no files are transferred to iPhone is to reauthorize the iTunes so that your Mac or PC will be permitted to access your music, photos, movies, audiobooks and apps. 

4\. Check the version of your drivers for outdated drivers may lead to iTunes sync grey out on iPhone problem. Upgrade to the latest up-to-date drivers. 

5\. Reboot or Hard Reboot your iPhone to get iTunes syncing worked again. Hold down the Power button and Home button till your iPhone restarts. 

6\. Install the latest version of Windows or Mac and restart the computer again, in case your iTunes sync gray out error is not caused by iPhone, iTunes, or related Apple accessories. 

7\. Change a USB port or cable, e.g. a Lightning cable or the 30-pin adapters, because some iffy USB cable or port may lead to iTunes syncing failure to iPhone iPad or iPod. 

8\. Resort to wireless syncing method instead of iTunes syncing to iPhone with USB. Make sure that both iPhone and your computer are on the same wireless network. Go to your iPhone Setting -> General -> iTUnes Wi-Fi Sync - Sync now. 

9\. Disable the third-party security software if you get the "Error-54" that a sign of iPhone cannot be synced in iTunes.

10\. If all the steps listed above have been done but your iPhone still won't sync with iTunes, we suggest you try iTunes alternative to sync files to iPhone flawlessly.
