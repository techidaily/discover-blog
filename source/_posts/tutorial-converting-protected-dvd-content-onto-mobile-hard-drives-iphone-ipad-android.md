**What is CSS?**

CSS stands for Content Scramble System and was used to prevent the commercial DVDs from being illegally copied, shared, etc. The purpose of CSS is two fold:

• It prevents byte-for-byte copies of an MPEG (digital video) stream from being playable since such copies do not include the keys that are hidden on the lead-in area of the protected DVD.

• It provides a reason for manufacturers to make their devices compliant with an industry-controlled standard, since CSS scrambled disks can not play on noncompliant devices. Anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license, which contains the requirement that the rest of the copy-protection system be implemented.

You may be not familiar with this copy protection term, but you may have experienced the troubles it brought: when you want to rip CSS protected DVD to hard drive with DVD video recorder, or import it into your iPhone iPad Android for watching on the go, you got unread error or the converted files usually out of order.
