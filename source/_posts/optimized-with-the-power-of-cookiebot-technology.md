[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)®, a global provider of content intelligence services, today announced it will be among the leading strategists sharing practical lessons on how enterprises can use artificial intelligence technology to impact their business during the [AI Summit New York](https://theaisummit.com/newyork/ "AI Summit New York"), the world’s largest AI event for business. Taking place December 5-6, 2018, AI Summit New York focuses on actual AI solutions that are transforming business productivity.

Anthony Macciola, Chief Innovation Officer, is presenting a session December 5 titled, “Making Enterprise AI Robots Smarter with Content Intelligence.” Demonstrations of its content intelligence solutions that digitize structured and unstructured data into information that can be used by AI-enabling technologies to deliver business value will be available at booth 504.

“AI-enabling technologies are having a real business impact today, but organizations need to look beyond using AI to improve efficiencies in human productivity,” commented Macciola. “There are so many technologies that fall under the AI umbrella including natural language processing and machine learning technologies that can be used today to deliver insight, context and enhanced decisioning. My goal is to educate and inspire organizations to transform their customer-facing business processes using content intelligence solutions.”
