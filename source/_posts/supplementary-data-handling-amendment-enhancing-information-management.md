1.4\. General terms of business of the Client shall only apply if and insofar as ABBYY has explicitly accepted them in writing.

2.2\. "Data Subject" means the individual to whom Personal Data relates.

2.5\. "Instruction" means the written instruction, issued by Client to ABBYY, and directing the same to perform a specific action with regard to Personal Data (including, but not limited to, de­personalizing, blocking, deletion, making available).

In some circumstances, Client may be a Processor, in which case Client appoints ABBYY as Client's Sub-processor, which shall not change the obligations of either Client or ABBYY under this DPA, as ABBYY will always remain a Processor with respect to the Client in such event.

3.2\. Client retains control of the Personal Data and remains responsible for its compliance with its obligations under the applicable Data Protection Laws, including providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents for the lawful processing of Personal Data made available to

or otherwise transferred to ABBYY, and for the processing instructions it gives to ABBYY.

3.3\. ABBYY shall process Personal Data on behalf of Client. Processing shall include such actions as

may be specified in the Agreement and in the Statement of Work. Within the scope of the Agreement, Client shall be solely responsible for complying with the statutory requirements relating to the lawfulness of the data Processing.

3.4\. Based on this responsibility, Client shall be entitled to request that ABBYY, subject to the Data Protection Laws, rectifies, deletes, blocks and makes available Personal Data during and after the term of the Agreement at Client's cost. ABBYY shall promptly comply with any of Client's request or instruction requiring ABBYY to amend, transfer, delete or otherwise process the Personal Data,

or to stop, mitigate or remedy any unauthorized Processing.

3.5\. The provisions of this DPA shall also apply if testing or maintenance of automatic processes or of Processing equipment is performed on behalf of Client.

3.6\. ABBYY may use Personal Data for developing and improving ABBYY's products (“R&D Purposes”). These R&D Purposes may also include troubleshooting and maintenance aimed at preventing, detecting and repairing problems affecting the operation of ABBYY products and the improvement of features that involve the detection of, and protection against, emerging and evolving threats to the user (such as malware or spam) as well as upgrading and updating ABBYY products. ABBYY may engage its affiliates and other companies to perform such processing. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, Client grants ABBYY rights to continue to keep and process Personal Data for R&D Purposes.

ABBYY shall process Personal Data only within the scope of Client's Instructions as set-out in this Agreement, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the ABBYY is subject. In this case, the ABBYY shall inform Client of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

4.2\. ABBYY will, insofar this is possible, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, reasonably assist Client with meeting Client's compliance obligations with respect to the rights exercised by Data Subjects under the Data Protection Laws (particularly the Data Subject's Rights stated in Chapter 3 of the UK GDPR and related to Data Subject's requests), taking into account the nature of data Processing. Taking into account the nature of Processing and any information available to ABBYY, ABBYY will further assist the Client in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 the UK GDPR, in particular its obligations to undertake data protection impact assessments and report to and consult with supervisory authorities under the Data Protection Laws. In a situation where, requested level of assistance will be excessive or unreasonably burdensome for ABBYY, any such assistance will be exercised at Client's cost.

4.3\. ABBYY shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures required pursuant to Article 32 the UK GDPR with respect to the Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects. Such measures shall be designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in order to protect Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, access or use. Such measures hereunder shall include, but are not limited to taking reasonable steps to achieve the following:

A) the prevention of unauthorized persons from gaining access to Personal Data Processing systems (physical access control),

B) the prevention of Personal Data Processing systems from being used without authorization (logical access control),

C) persons entitled to use a Personal Data Processing system gain access only to such Personal Data as they are entitled to accessing in accordance with their access rights, and that, in the course of processing or use and after storage, Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization (data access control),

The parties acknowledge that, in relation to the above-mentioned processing of personal data, each party will be free to determine the lawful purpose and the means of such processing and therefore will act as separate data controller. In no event will this Clause imply that the parties can be considered joint controllers.

##### 10\. International Data Transfers

10.1\. ABBYY is authorized to process Personal Data itself as well as including its engagement of Sub-processors in accordance with this DPA outside the country in which the Client is located including countries where the data protection may not be as stringent in the country of Client's domicile or registered address or the EEA, Switzerland or UK.

10.2\. ABBYY shall process Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or UK as permitted under the Data Protection Laws as follows:

(i) the Personal Data of an EEA, UK or Swiss based Client is processed in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, UK (a “third country”) that is determined by the European Union to have adequate level of data protection under Art. 45 the UK GDPR; or

(ii) the Personal Data of Client is processed in a third country pursuant to adequate safeguards under Art. 46 the UK GDPR including, but not limited to execution of Standard Contractual Clauses or an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism.

In case of data transfers from the EEA: ABBYY has valid and actual Processor-to-Processor SCCs in place with all sub-processors located outside the European Economic Area or another country accepted by the European Union as adequate in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR.

In case of data transfers from the UK: by way of example only, when ABBYY uses SCC as safeguard, ABBYY has entered into the unchanged version of the Standard Contractual Clauses prior to the Sub-processor's processing of Personal Data. Client hereby (itself as well as on behalf of each Controller established within the EEA, UK or Switzerland) accedes to the SCC between ABBYY and the Sub-processor. ABBYY will enforce the SCC against the Sub-­processor on behalf of the Client or Data Subject if a direct enforcement right is not available under Data Protection Laws. In the SCCs, some words and definitions shall have meaning tailored to the UK, for instance: “Member State” and “State” shall mean “jurisdiction”; “supervisory authority” shall mean the relevant data protection regulator or other government body with authority to enforce data protection laws; and references to “applicable data protection laws” and “Directive 95/46/EC” shall mean “applicable data protection laws”.
