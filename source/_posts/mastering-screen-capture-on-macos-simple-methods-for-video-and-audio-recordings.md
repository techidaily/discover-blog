## Part 1: How to Record Screen on Mac with Audio Using QuickTime 

QuickTime is far from perfect when you want to [record Mac screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) together with audio the computer is producing, even when you raise the volume on your speakers. This following steps are in response to QuickTime not recoding sound error. 

**Step 1:** Go to [Github](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/tag/2.0b2) to finding Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg to download and install Soundflower, which is actually an extension to Mac devices that allows you to route system audio within your Mac. 

**Step 2:** Restart your system so as to avoid any recording trouble. 

**Step 3:** Go to Sound system preference, select the Output tab and choose SoundFlower (2ch) for current audio recording.

QuickTime player is totally free and easy to use, which generates videos with high quality. But it isn't the best option for Mac screen recording with sound, because of the following problems:

1. QuickTime player cannot record the audio playing on your Mac during screen recording. You have to rely on SoundFlower or others to capture both sound and video with Mac screen.
2. You have to do some settings before and after the screen recording process, which is troublesome and time-consuming.
3. You have to disconnect SoundFlower in order to hear sound from speakers.
4. QuickTime Player gives no more control in the output options. You cannot record the screen in a format other than MOV or MP4\. Besides, the resolution is restricted within 1080p or 720p. This means you have to rely on other software to convert the recorded video to other format for further playing or uploading.
5. Many screen recorders for Mac, including QuickTime, are prohibited from capturing DRM-protected videos, e.g. iTunes movies, or the copy protected DVDs. So you have to rip the protected DVD or remove DRM from iTunes first before recording.
