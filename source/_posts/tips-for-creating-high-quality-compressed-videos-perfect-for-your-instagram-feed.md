_Q: When I upload a video to instagram it comes out very poor quality and blurry. Before I post it, it is in high quality on my phone and is perfectly clear. Is there a way to fix this? To make the video on Instagram just as clear as on my phone?_ \- From GoPro Forum

Sharing videos on Instagram has become a vital part of people's live. But things always go wrong owing to the large file size especially for HD or 4K ultra HD videos. So to upload a HD video to Instagram, the first thing comes to process and compress videos for Instagram, which is not confined to reducing the video file size, but also changing the format/codec, adjusting resolution, frame rate, bit rate etc., and editing videos. It means that is essential to grab a Instagram video compressor to make HD video available for Instagram.

### Video Upload Technical Requirements for Instagram 

Before you shrink HD video for Instagram or Instagram Story, it's fatal to learn about the requirements for [Instagram video uploading](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Here is the specific demands for sharing videos on Instagram. 

* File Size: Maximum of 4GB
* Duration: 3 seconds to 60 seconds
* Video Formats: MP4 and MOV.
* Frame rate: 30fps max
* Audio codec: AAC, 128kbps is best for Instagram.
* Resolution: Maximum 1920×1080 pixels, Minimum resolution goes 600×315 pixels for landscape, 600×600 pixels for square, and 600×750 pixels for vertical video.
* Bitrate: No limit to bitrate file if you're using two pass encoding, as long as your video doesn't exceed 1GB. Otherwise 8 megabits per second for 1080p and 4 megabits per second for 720p.
* Aspect ratio: Landscape (1.91:1), Square (1:1), Vertical (4:5). 1:1 Square video at 1080×1080 pixels is commonly used.

## How to Shrink Video for Instagram with High Quality 

Actually, if you have a video that meets all the requirements for Insta except in higher resolution like iPhone 4K video, you'll find it looks blurry since Instagram will shrink the file and lower the quality in the background as soon as you upload it. In order to keep the excellent quality of your video, you need a software to compress video for Instagram uploading. 

[**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is featured to compress and process videos for Instagram, involving various ways: 

* Change large footprint format to [Instagram video format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), like MKV to MP4, MTS to MOV, and transcode video to H.264, VP9 from HEVC, MPEG4 etc.
* Downscale video resolution to 640p from 720p/1080p and even 4K without losing quality, lower bitrate to 3500kbps and reduce frame rate to 29.96fps.
* Trim the length of video to make it no more than 60 seconds, and crop the pixel dimension to finally reduce the video file size for Instagram.

Better yet, this Instagram HD video shrinker processes and compresses MP4 video in an incredible fast speed but highest quality reserved in the efforts of multi-core utility, Hyper-threading tech and High-Quality engine. If you happen to have a i5 or i7 processor on Macs with Intel QSV hardware acceleration built in or a hardware accelerated graphic card like Nvidia GeForce, AMD Radeon™ HD 7000 Series or better, MacX will speed up the Instagram video size reduction up to 5 times faster.
